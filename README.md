# Linear Regression Using Gradient Descent (Part 1)

## Description
This project implements **linear regression from scratch** using **gradient descent** to predict final student grades (`G3`) from the UCI Student Performance dataset. Categorical features are one-hot encoded, and features are standardized.

## How to Run
1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed.
2. Install required packages:
   python3 -m pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn ucimlrepo
3. Run the script:
   python3 part1.py

##Part 2 - SGDRegressor model 
   #description: The difference between the first part and the second part is that we are usign the scikit learn package model. We are using the sgd regressor model to compare with the linear regression model we had made. 

##How to run Part 2 
1. Python3 installed from previous part
2. Run the script:
   python3 part2.py
